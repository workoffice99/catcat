                Bored Fancy Cat's is an NFT limited edition collection of 4417
                Cat's characters created from Pop elements in the mix with
                unique Holographic background with Pop style and stored as
                ERC-721 tokens on the Polygon blockchain....
                <br />
                <br /> Through the Bored Fancy Cat's initiative, we hope to help
                other artists bring their art to the world through the
                blockchain path.Part of the funds collected from the sale of the
                first collection will be allocated to sponsoring upcoming new
                artists who stand out with their talent but can't afford to
                launch a collection due to the costs involved.The artists will
                be pre-selected with the help from the Bored Fancy Cat's NFT
                holders and the Bored Fancy Cat's team.
